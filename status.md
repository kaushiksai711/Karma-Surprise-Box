Progress Analysis (Week 3 Completion Status)

‚úÖ Completed (Weeks 1-3)

Week 1: Data Simulation ‚úÖ

Implemented in dataset.py with synthetic user data generation

Created realistic user behavior patterns and engagement metrics

Week 2: Model Training ‚úÖ

Implemented in Classifier.py

Trained RandomForestClassifier with strong metrics:

Accuracy: 90-91%
Precision: ~0.89
Recall: ~0.93
AUC-ROC: ~0.97

Added cross-validation and model persistence

Week 3: Scoring + Reward Logic ‚úÖ

Implemented in reward_engine.py

Created rule-based reward conditions (conditions.csv)

Added reward calculation logic

Implemented rarity determination

Added testing (testing.py)

üîÑ Partially Completed (Week 4-5)

Week 4: FastAPI Service (Partially Done)


Basic API structure exists but needs FastAPI implementation

Missing Pydantic models and proper endpoints

Week 5: Configuration & Rules (Partially Done)

Basic config.json exists

Some reward rules implemented but needs full integration

‚ùå Not Started (Week 6)

Dockerization

Final Validation

API Documentation

Deployment Setup
Current Status: End of Week 3 + Partial Week 4

I've successfully completed the core machine learning and reward logic components (Weeks 1-3) and have made progress into Week 4's tasks. 
The main components that need attention are:



FastAPI Implementation:

Convert existing logic into FastAPI endpoints
Add Pydantic models for request/response validation
Implement health check and version endpoints

Configuration:

Finalize config.json with all required parameters

Ensure all reward rules are properly configured

API Documentation:
Add Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
Document all endpoints and their usage

Dockerization:

Create Dockerfile
Add docker-compose if needed
Document deployment process
