üîÑ In Progress (Week 5)
Configuration & Rules
Basic config.json implemented
Reward rules configured
Need to finalize all rule parameters
Need to add more test cases for edge cases
‚ùå Not Started (Week 6)
Dockerization
Final validation
Deployment setup
Performance testing
Current Status: End of Week 4

### Next Steps:
1. **Week 5 Tasks**:
   - Finalize all configuration parameters
   - Add more test cases
   - Optimize reward rules
   - Document all configuration options

2. **Week 6 Tasks**:
   - Create Dockerfile
   - Set up CI/CD pipeline
   - Perform final validation
   - Prepare deployment documentation

### Notes:
- The API is now fully functional and matches the specified requirements
- All endpoints are documented and can be tested via Swagger UI
- The system is ready for integration with frontend services
- No authentication is currently implemented as per requirements
